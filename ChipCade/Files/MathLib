# Math.DEG2RAD: Converts degrees to radians
# Inputs:
#   - R0: Angle in degrees
# Outputs:
#   - R1: Angle in radians
# Description:
#   Multiplies the input angle in degrees by π/180 to convert it to radians.
DEG2RAD:
    LDI R1 R0           # Load the input angle (degrees) into R1
    MUL R1 0.0174533f   # Multiply R1 by π/180 to convert to radians
